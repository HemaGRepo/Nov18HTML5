                    <summary class="display-5 text-success">Honesty</summary>
                    <p>Honesty signifies loyalty, integrity, uprightness, a complete refusal to use any underhanded method to help win business or gain any kind of advantage. Neither growth nor profit nor independence have any real worth unless they are won through complete honesty and probity. And everyone in the Group knows that any lack of openness and integrity in our business dealings will be penalized at once.</p>

                <details class="px-5">
                    <summary class="display-5 text-success">Modesty</summary>
                    <p>Modesty, that is simplicity, the very opposite of affectation, pretension, pomposity, arrogance and boastfulness. Simplicity does not imply naivety ‘simple does not mean simpleton!); it is more about being discreet, showing natural modesty, common sense, being attentive to others and taking the trouble to be understood by them. It is about being frank in work relationships, loosening up, having a sense of humor.</p>

                <details class="px-5">
                    <summary class="display-5 text-success">Fun</summary>
                    <p>Fun means feeling good about being part of the company or one’s team, feeling proud of what one does, feeling a sense of accomplishment in the search for better quality and greater efficiency, feeling part of a challenging project. </p>

           <mark>Boldness</mark> 
            Boldness, which implies a flair for entrepreneurship and a desire to take considered risks and show commitment (naturally linked to a firm determination to uphold one’s commitments). This is the very soul of competitiveness: firmness in making decisions or in forcing their implementation, an acceptance periodically to challenge one’s orientations and the status quo. Boldness also needs to be combined with a certain level of prudence and a particular clear sightedness, without which a bold manager is, in reality, merely dangerously reckless.

    <article class="text-justify col-3">
            <mark>Trust</mark>
            Trust, meaning the willingness to empower both individuals and teams; to have decisions made as close as possible to the point where they will be put into practice. Trust also means giving priority, within the company, to real openness toward other people and the widest possible sharing of ideas and information.
